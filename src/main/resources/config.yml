#
# universal_mailboxes: false
# Right-click any mailbox to open your own mailbox if true, otherwise you must click your own
# 
# login_notifications: true
# Notify players if they have mail on login
# 
# mailbox_rows: 2
# how many rows a mailbox should have
# Be careful when making smaller, any letters above the space you specify will be lost
# 
# max_attachments: 4
# How many item stacks can be added to a package
# 
# enable_mail_command: true
# Show instructions on how to use and craft on /mail
# 
# let_players_spawn_stationary: false
# Will let players spawn in stationery using "/mail new" instead of crafting
# This stationery will not be tradable with villagers
# 
# delivery_time: 6000
# The time of day in ticks that queued mail will be delivered
# Set to -1 for instantaneous/express sending of mail
# Not yet implemented
#
# let_players_spawn_stationary: false
# Gives non-ops access to the /mail new command allowing them to just spawn in stationary
# instead of needing to craft some
#
# lock_mailboxes: true
# Only allow players to view their own mailboxes to prevent theft from other mailboxes
#
# prefix: "&f[&6Mail&f]"
# Prefix for every message sent by RealMail
#
# verbose_errors: false
# More detailed error logging for debugging and sending in bug reports
#
# offline_mode: false
# This allows servers which do not connect to Mojang's authentication servers to still
# use this plugin. Enabling this option will query Mojang's servers for each player's
# UUIDs so that mailbox information may be saved and be safe from future name changes.
# This will lag the server for a short amount of time (usually 1-2 seconds) each time a
# new player logs in, but their UUID will then be cached and never retrieved from Mojang
# again. Servers behind bungee-cord that are configured correctly will not need to enable
# this option as offical Mojang UUIDs are forwarded to the servers.
#
# reusable_feather: true
# Allows the feather to not be used when crafting stationery. In other words, one piece
# of paper and one feather will produce one piece of stationery and the same feather. This
# works similar to how filled buckets work when included in a crafting recipe.
#
# enable_sounds: true
# A ding will play when a player receives mail and when a player successfully sends mail.
